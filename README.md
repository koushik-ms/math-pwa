# Math-PWA Ionic

This is an attempt to design and develop an Ionic App from scratch. This helped in learning Ionic, Angular, Typescript etc.,.

It's a simple 1-page application which keeps throwing multiplication problems and allows user to enter solutions. If solution is correct user score keeps increasing. Otherwise it decreases.

# Features / Requirements

** Done **
1. Randomize problem presentation.
2. Make the app usable on even small screens with small UI. Design UI to keep keyboard occlusion to minimum.
3. Keep UI really simple for kids to be able to use it.
4. Allow user to view overall and item-wise scores.
6. Allow sign-in from google
7. Design icon/ splash for app to make it stand-out and appeal.

** Pending / TODO **

5. Persist data locally
6. Gamify progress by showing score milestones, badges etc.,.
7. Covert into alexa skill to enable voice prompting and checking.
3. Can this be a PWA + Ionic App ? Deployeable in 2 ways.
